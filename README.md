# Code Smells
* Duplicated Code
* Poor abstraction (Change one place -> must change others)
* Large loop, method, class, parameter list; deeply nested loop
* Class has too little cohesion
* Modules have too much coupling
* Class has poor encapsulation
* Subclass doesn't use majority of iunherited functionalities
* A "data class" has little functionality
* Dead code
* Design is unncessarily general
* Design is too specific
